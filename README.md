# video based W-RPN

##  Using W-RPN trained on videos

Pre-trained RPN on the videos as describe in the paper can be found at [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J_wjO70QMkE8MlOIpcL8SegEl9Y8bmv7)

Model was trained using the code based on Faster-RCNN (https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch). We use pseudo ground-truth boxes obtained using motion segments as described in the paper. To obtain proposals use the test_net.py.

More coming soon!!
